# Project Cleanup Summary

## ðŸ§¹ What Was Removed

### **Broken/Experimental Services**
- `app/services/openai_service_broken.py` - Non-functional service implementation
- `app/services/openai_service_fixed.py` - Alternative service implementation (not needed)

### **Outdated Documentation**
- `CRITICAL_FIXES.md` - Documentation for broken features
- `FEATURE_COMPARISON.md` - Comparison of broken vs working features
- `debug_instructions.md` - Debug instructions for broken features

### **Unnecessary Scripts**
- `test_deployment.sh` - Test script for broken features

## âœ… What Was Kept

### **Core Working System**
- `app/services/openai_service.py` - Main working service
- `app/api/websocket.py` - WebSocket endpoint
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application
- `app/models/schemas.py` - Data models
- `app/static/` - Static files

### **Integration & Deployment**
- `storyline_integration.js` - Storyline integration script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker deployment
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration

### **Documentation**
- `README.md` - Clean, focused documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide for working features

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Project Focus**

The cleaned project now focuses exclusively on:

1. **Real-time Speech-to-Speech Communication**
   - WebSocket-based audio streaming
   - OpenAI Realtime API integration
   - Low-latency audio processing

2. **De-escalation Training Integration**
   - Storyline course integration
   - Performance assessment
   - Real-time coaching feedback

3. **Production-Ready Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Scalable architecture
   - Comprehensive monitoring

## ðŸ”§ **Benefits of Cleanup**

- **Reduced Confusion**: No more broken/experimental features
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single working implementation
- **Clear Documentation**: Focus on what actually works
- **Smaller Codebase**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Better User Experience**: Users only see working features

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

The project is now ready for:
- Production deployment
- Feature development
- User onboarding
- Community contributions

All remaining code has been tested and verified to work with the `story.html` functionality.
